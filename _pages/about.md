I am a postdoctoral scholar at Carnegie Mellon University in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, advised by Dr. [Marc De Graef](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/materials/people/faculty/bios/de_graef.html/). Research topics that I care about:
  * understanding failure mechanism of metals
  * sustainability of metal manufacturing through microstructure tuning
  * high-throughput material design and characterization

sth professional
======
I received my Ph.D from UC San Diego in 2019, advised by  Dr. [Kenneth Vecchio](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/kennethvecchioresearchgroup/) ~~who enjoys fishing, Fishing and  FISHING~~. I obtained my B.Eng. from Imperial College London ~~Royal School of Mines~~ in 2015. During my time in Europe, I spent a brief amount of time working with Dr. [Ben Britton](https://www.expmicromech.com/) as an undergraduate researcher and a summer working with Dr. [Cem Tasan](https://tasan.mit.edu/research/) (now at MIT) at the Max Planck Institute for Iron Research as a DAAD RISE scholar.

sth personal
======
I was born ~~illegally~~ and raised ~~under a lot of pressure~~ in Deqing, Zhejiang, China. At an early age of my life, I have learnt to ~~unwillingly~~ share my ice-cream with my elder sister.

what I do when I am not in front of a computer
======
Most probably I am just staring at my cat sitting in front of my computer. I also particularly enjoy video games, fingerpicking, tennis, photography.
