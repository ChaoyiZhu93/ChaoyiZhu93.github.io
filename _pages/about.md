Welcome!
======
My name is Chaoyi Zhu. I am a microscopist, metallurgist, and software developer. I write code and develop open-source software to study crystallography of materials and track evolution of defects with SEM. In addition, I am an enthusiast for machine learning, optimization, and high-throughput experimentation, and an amateur guitar player and photographer. Currently, I work as a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley, and I live with my wife and my cat. And in my spare time, I love cooking, playing tennis and basketball with my friends.


Research interests
=====
* defect characterization in scanning electron microscope
* machine learning for electron microscopy
* sustainability in alloy development
