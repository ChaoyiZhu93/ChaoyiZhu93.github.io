Welcome to my Page!
======
Currently, I work as a Senior Metrology Systems Engineer in the 4680 Cell Engineering Team at Tesla.

I am a microscopist, metallurgist, and software developer. I am also an amateur guitar player and photographer. And in my spare time, I love cooking, playing tennis and basketball with my friends.


Research interests
=====
* defect characterization for failure analysis and quality control
* automation and machine learning for electron microscopy
* materials informatics: sustainability in materials development
