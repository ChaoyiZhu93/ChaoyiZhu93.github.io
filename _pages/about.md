Welcome to my Page!
======
My name is Chaoyi Zhu. I am a microscopist, metallurgist, and software developer. Currently, I work at Eurofins | EAG Laboratory to help our clients solve materials related problems.

I am an expert in SEM based techniques such as  EBSD and ECCI in both experimentation and modelling.  My focus with EBSD is on deformation study of materials including defect density, and residual strain analysis. Similarly, I use ECCI to measure surface threading dislocations in semiconductors such as GaN, etc as well as dislocation walls in metallic materials.

I am an enthusiast for computer vision, machine learning, optimization, and high-throughput experimentation. In the past, I have used these methods to solve problems in materials testing and characterization. A few publications can be found under the publication tab.

Recently, I am getting interested in the materials informatics domain where materials selection for consumer products can be optimized to reduce carbon footprint. 

I am an amateur guitar player and photographer. And in my spare time, I love cooking, playing tennis and basketball with my friends.
