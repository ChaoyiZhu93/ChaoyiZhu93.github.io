I am a Research Associate at Carnegie Mellon University in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering working in Professor [Marc De Graef](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/materials/people/faculty/bios/de_graef.html/)'s group. 

My recent research update:
  * simulation based absolute strain/stress mapping.
  * pattern center and orientation refinement with global optimization algorithms.
  * virtual EBSD technique to probe mesoscale deformation information.
  * analytical form of strain field for surface dislocation and dislocation segments.
  * interaction volume EBSD simulation to understand surface defects.
  * dictionary indexing approach to characterize dislocation in ECCI.
  * hybrid convolutional neural network.
  * crystal plasticity modeling/DDD simulation
  
My past research projects:  
  * micro/macro strain mapping techniques based on computer vision algorithm.
  * residual stress measurement in additively manufactured materials.
  * phase mapping technique using convolutional neural network. 
  * automated spherical Kikuchi sphere reconstruction from experimental patterns.
  * microstructure/crystallographic anisotropy effects on shear localization properties.
  * determine statistically stored dislocation density.
  * GND assisted dislocation pipe diffusion in sintered iron.
  * design of heterogeneous lamella structure and back-stress strengthening.
  * in-situ deformation in SEM.

professional background
======
I received my Ph.D from UC San Diego in 2019, advised by  Professor [Kenneth Vecchio](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/kennethvecchioresearchgroup/). I obtained my B.Eng. from Imperial College London in 2015. During my time in Europe, I spent a brief amount of time working with Professor [Ben Britton](https://www.expmicromech.com/) as an undergraduate researcher and a summer working with Professor [Cem Tasan](https://tasan.mit.edu/research/) (now at MIT) at the Max Planck Institute for Iron Research as a DAAD RISE scholar.
