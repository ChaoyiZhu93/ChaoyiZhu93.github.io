I am a postdoctoral scholar at Carnegie Mellon University in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, advised by Professor [Marc De Graef](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/materials/people/faculty/bios/de_graef.html/). 
  * I am interested in sustainable design for metallic alloys through microstructure tuning. 
  * I enjoy looking at pretty Kikuchi patterns to understand microstructure, texture, and deformation mechanisms of crystalline materials. 
  * I have developed alternative micro/macro strain mapping techniques based on computer vision algorithm and phase mapping technique using convolutional neural network. 
  * Recently, I started to explore the the optimization landscape for full deformation tensor inference from Kikuchi patterns and...
  * the possibility of characterizing single dislocations using low-voltage EBSD.
 

professional background
======
I received my Ph.D from UC San Diego in 2019, advised by  Professor [Kenneth Vecchio](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/kennethvecchioresearchgroup/). I obtained my B.Eng. from Imperial College London in 2015. During my time in Europe, I spent a brief amount of time working with Professor [Ben Britton](https://www.expmicromech.com/) as an undergraduate researcher and a summer working with Professor [Cem Tasan](https://tasan.mit.edu/research/) (now at MIT) at the Max Planck Institute for Iron Research as a DAAD RISE scholar.
