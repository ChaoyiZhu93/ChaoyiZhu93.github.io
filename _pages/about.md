Welcome to my Page!
======
I am Chaoyi. I am a microscopist, metallurgist, and software developer. Currently, I work at Eurofins | EAG Laboratory to help our clients solve materials related problems. We provide a variety of scientific services such as surface contamination analysis, reliablity study of microelectronics, large-scale microstructure/texture analysis, high resolution e-beam metrology, etc.

My research focus with EBSD is on deformation study of materials including defect density, and residual strain analysis. Similarly, I also use ECCI to measure surface threading dislocations in semiconductors such as GaN, etc as well as dislocation walls in metallic materials.

I am also an enthusiast for computer vision, machine learning, optimization, and high-throughput experimentation. In the past, I have designed and built image registration based imaging system to track surface deformation of objects with and without surface patterning. I have also initiated ideas and led projects to integrate deep learning method to crystal structure classication and orientaiotn determination.  

I am an amateur guitar player and photographer. And in my spare time, I love cooking, playing tennis and basketball with my friends.
