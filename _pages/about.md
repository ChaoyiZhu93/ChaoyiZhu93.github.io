I am a Research Associate at Carnegie Mellon University in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering working in Professor [Marc De Graef](http://www.materials.cmu.edu/degraef/)'s group. I am currently working on a virtual characterization method (because we are still in a lockdown) to strengthen our understanding of continuum dislocation theory with the help of discrete dislocation dynamics simulation and crystal plasticity finite element modeling. I am also studying how crystal deformation affects the diffraction pattern and thinking about ways to measure the absolute strain state using simulated patterns. 

For my Ph.D. study, I smashed a lot of metals and alloys with expensive machines to understand their mechanical behavior. I also took snapshots of the deformation process with the equipment we built in the lab to analyze heterogeneous strain evolution. By firing high-speed electrons at the sample, I was also able to extract micromechanical information (defect density, residual stresses, etc) to assist failure diagnosis and work with the alloy design team to make stronger and tougher materials. A brief resume about myself can be downloaded here: [Chaoyi Zhu's Resume](http://ChaoyiZhu93.github.io/files/Chaoyi_Zhu_Resume_2021.pdf)

In my spare time, I enjoy playing classical guitar and watching documentaries. I also exercise a lot every day, trying to close all my rings. I love playing tennis and basketball with my friends, and playing with my cat.

professional background
======
I received my Ph.D from UC San Diego in 2019, advised by  Professor [Kenneth Vecchio](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/kennethvecchioresearchgroup/). I obtained my B.Eng. from Imperial College London in 2015. During my time in Europe, I spent a brief amount of time working with Professor [Ben Britton](https://www.expmicromech.com/) as an undergraduate researcher and a summer working with Professor [Cem Tasan](https://tasan.mit.edu/research/) (now at MIT) at the Max Planck Institute for Iron Research as a DAAD RISE scholar.
